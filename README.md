**HL2Patcher** makes *Half-Life 2* playable on modern ARM Macs that only support 64-bit applications. Its goal is to simplify the patching process into an easy-to-use app, so anyone can enjoy the game again without hassle.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HL2Patcher is currently **not functioning correctly** and will not be updated or fixed for the time being. The tool either gets stuck on the cleanup stage during patching or fails to launch due to issues with the packaged Python environment.

## üõ† How It Works  

With Apple dropping support for 32-bit applications, *Half-Life 2* and its version of the Source Engine no longer function on macOS. HL2Patcher resolves this by retrieving a modified version of the Source Engine code and compiling it for ARM-based 64-bit architecture, so the game can run again.  

## üîß Requirements  

- macOS **Big Sur (11.0)** or later
- A copy of *Half-Life 2* installed via Steam

## üì• Installation  

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kacper-jar/HL2Patcher/releases).  
2. Extract the app and move it to the Applications folder.  
3. Launch HL2Patcher and follow the on-screen instructions.

## üö® Why Does macOS Say HL2Patcher Cannot Be Opened?

Since HL2Patcher is not notarized by Apple, you may see a warning when trying to open the app:

> *"Apple could not verify 'HL2Patcher' is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy."*

To bypass this warning:

1. Open **System Settings** ‚Üí **Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
3. You should see a message about HL2Patcher being blocked. Click **"Open Anyway."**
4. Confirm your choice when prompted.

This is a standard warning for apps that are not notarized by Apple. HL2Patcher is open-source, so you can inspect the code or build it yourself if you have concerns.

## üóÇ Why Does HL2Patcher Need Access to the Documents Folder?  

macOS asks for permission to access your Documents folder because of the file picker functionality in HL2Patcher. This is a standard permission request when the app needs to interact with files on your system.  

It is **recommended** that you allow this permission for HL2Patcher to function as intended, but everything should work fine as long as you don't select the "Documents" folder during the file selection process. 

## üèó How to Build  

To build HL2Patcher from source, you'll need **Python 3.12 or newer**.  

1. Clone the repository
2. Assign execution permissions to the build script:
   ```sh
    chmod +x build-macos.sh
    ```
3. Run the build script:
   ```sh
    ./build-macos.sh
    ```
